# Hand Detection and Sign Language Conversion App

This PyQt5 application utilizes hand detection techniques to convert hand gestures into sign language symbols. The application captures video from the camera, processes it using MediaPipe for hand detection, and converts the detected gestures into letters, the letter are sent to chatGPT 3.5 turbo for respond and the return respond are displaced in text and sign emoji for readabilty of choice.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and gesture recognition
- Conversion of gestures to letters
- Display of sign language symbols corresponding to the detected gestures
- Text input field for composing messages using sign language symbols
- Text display field for viewing the composed messages


## Requirements
All requirement are stated in the requirement file

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage
To use this app first check the image file to know the possible sign detections images.
1. Run the application by executing the Python script.
2. Position your hand in front of the camera to start detecting gestures.
3. As you make hand gestures, the application will convert them into letters and display the corresponding sign language symbols.
4. Compose messages using the sign language symbols in the text input field.
5. View the composed messages in the text display field.
6. Click on submit button after composing your message for respond from chatGPT 3.5 turbo
7. You can also edit message using the keyboard
